        </a>
        <p class="list-text">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used
            to structure and display a web page and its content. For example, content
            can be structured within multiple paragraphs, bulleted lists, or using images
            and data tables. As the name suggests, this article will give you a basic
            understanding of HTML and its functions.

        <p class="list-text">JavaScript® (often just JS) is a lightweight, interpreted or
            JIT-compiled, object-oriented language with first-class functions. It is most
            widely used as a scripting language for web pages, but it is also used in other
            software products, for example, node.js or Apache CouchDB. JavaScript is a
            prototype-oriented, multi-paradigm language with dynamic typing that supports
            object-oriented, imperative and declarative (for example, functional programming)
            programming styles. Learn more about JavaScript.

        </a>
        <p class="list-text">PHP (/pi:. eɪtʃ. pi: / English PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor —
            "PHP: hypertext preprocessor"; originally PHP/FI (Personal Home Page / Form
            Interpreter), and later called Personal Home Page Tools[11] — "Tools for creating
            personal web pages") is a general-purpose scripting language[12], intensively used
            for developing web applications. Currently, it is supported by the vast majority of
            hosting providers and is one of the leaders among the languages used to create dynamic websites[13].
            The language and its interpreter (Zend Engine) are being developed by a group of enthusiasts as
            part of an open source project[14]. The project is distributed under its own license, which is incompatible
            with the GNU GPL.
